what is application configuration?

## Definition

Application configuration allows to customize, tweak or select - without recompilation ! - the features and general behaviour (e.g., performance and security) of an application and the libraries it uses. This covers configuration of *application-speci2c* options as well as options of the *3rd party libraries/frameworks* used by this application (e.g., Log4J or JDBC), but *excludes* configuration of an application's infrastructure (e.g., Docker, Chef or Puppet).
